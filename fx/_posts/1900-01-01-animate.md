Smoothly change CSS properties of the elements given in the current selection.

* `properties`: a CSS animation name or an object that specifies CSS properties and the final values to which they should be animated
* `duration` (default 0.4): duration of the animation in seconds
* `easing` (default `ease`): specifies the type of animation easing to use, one of `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out` or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#transition-timing-function_tag">`cubic-bezier(...)`</a>.
* `complete`: function that is called when the animation finishes

Zepto also supports the following extra properties that can be given individually instead as of being part of the `transform` CSS property: `translate(X|Y|Z|3d)`, `rotate(X|Y|Z|3d)`, `scale(X|Y|Z)`, `matrix(3d)`, `perspective`, and `skew(X|Y)`.

If the duration is set to `0` or `$.fx.off` is set to `true`, or the browser doesn't support CSS transitions, animations will not be executed; instead the final values will be set instantly.

{% highlight js %}
$("#some_element").animate({
  opacity: 0.25, left: '50px', rotateZ: '45deg', color: '#abcdef'
}, 2, 'ease-out')
{% endhighlight %}

<p class=compat>
  Zepto exclusively uses CSS transitions for effects and animation. 
  jQuery easings are not supported. jQuery's syntax for relative changes ("=+10px") is not supported.
  See the spec for a 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-properties-">list of animatable properties</a>.
  Browser support may vary, so be sure to test in all browsers you want to support.
