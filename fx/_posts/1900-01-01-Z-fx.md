Global settings for animations:

*   `$.fx.off` (default false in browsers that support CSS transitions): set to
    true to disable all [`animate()`](#animate) transitions.

*   `$.fx.speeds`: an object with duration settings for animations:

    * `_default` (400 ms)
    * `fast` (200 ms)
    * `slow` (600 ms)

    Change existing values or add new properties to affect animations that use
    a string for setting duration.
