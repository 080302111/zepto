diff: v1.1...v1.1.3
---

* Fix automatic parsing of JSON responses in `$.get/post`
* Don't falsely detect requests to URLs such as `/foo=?a=b` to be JSONP requests; the `=` is part of the request path in this case
* Use native `Array.isArray` if available
* Update to Uglify v2, saving ~1.6 kB in minified version
* Enabled `xhr.setRequestHeader()` in beforeSend Ajax handler (since v1.1.2)
