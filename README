zepto.js is a minimalist inlinable framework for mobile WebKit browsers,
with a jQuery-like chaining syntax

The ultimate goal is to have a ~2k library that handles most basic dredge work for you in a nice API so you can concentrate on getting stuff done. 

Primary target platforms are:

* iOS 4+
* Android 2.2+
* webOS 1.4.5+

Secondary platforms are:

* Safari 5+ (desktop)
* Chrome 5+ (desktop)

Syntax & features:

For now:
$('some css selector').html('set contents').css('set styles');

Best used if you stick in the contents of zepto.min.js into a <style> tag in your HTML (no need to load it form an external file).

I'd love some help on this, so please feel free to mess around!

Have fun!
