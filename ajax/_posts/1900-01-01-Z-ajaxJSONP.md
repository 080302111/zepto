  $.ajaxJSONP(options) â‡’ mock XMLHttpRequest
---

Perform a [JSONP][] request to another domain. JSONP request are not performed
with XMLHttpRequest, but by injecting a `<script>` to the document.  Most
[$.ajax](#$.ajax) options are supported, with the following considerations:

* `type` is always "GET"
* `url` needs to have the `=?` placeholder
* `contentType`, `dataType`, `headers`, and `async` are not supported.

The `?` placeholder in the URL is replaced with the dynamically generated name
of the callback function for this request. Typically the URL should contain the
query string such as `callback=?`; most servers expect the parameter to be
called like that.

The return value is a mock XMLHttpRequest object that only supports the
`abort()` method.

    // data is a js object, such as Object or Array
