Set the html contents of the current collection to the result of a GET Ajax call to the given URL. Optionally, a CSS selector can be specified in the URL, like so, to use only the HTML content matching the selector for updating the collection:

{% highlight js %}
$('#some_element').load('/foo.html #bar')
{% endhighlight %}

If no CSS selector is given, the complete response text is used instead.

Note that any JavaScript blocks found are only executed in case no selector is given.
