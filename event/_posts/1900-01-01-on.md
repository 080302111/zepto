Add event handlers to the elements in collection. Multiple event types can be
passed in a space-separated string, or as an object where event types are keys
and handlers are values. If a CSS selector is given, the handler function will 
only be called when an event originates from an element that matches the selector.

If the `data` argument is given, this value will be made available as the
`event.data` property during the execution of the event handler.

Event handlers are executed in the context of the element to which the handler
is attached, or the matching element in case a selector is provided. When an
event handler returns `false`, `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` is called for the current
event, preventing the default browser action such as following links.

If `false` is passed as argument to this method in place of the callback
function, it's equivalent to passing a function that returns `false`.

{% highlight js %}
var elem = $('#content')
// observe all clicks inside #content:
elem.on('click', function(e){ ... })
// observe clicks inside navigation links in #content
elem.on('click', 'nav a', function(e){ ... })
// all clicks inside links in the document
$(document).on('click', 'a', function(e){ ... })
// disable following any navigation link on the page
$(document).on('click', 'nav a', false)
{% endhighlight %}
