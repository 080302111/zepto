Add event handlers to the elements in collection. Multiple event types can be
passed in a space-separated string, or as an object where event types are keys
and handlers are values. If a CSS selector is given, the handler function will 
only be called when an event originates from an element that matches the selector.

Event handlers are executed in the context of the element to which the handler
is attached, or the matching element in case a selector is provided. When an
event handler returns `false`, `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` is called for the current
event, preventing the default browser action such as following links.

{% highlight js %}
var elem = $('#content')
// observe all clicks inside #content:
elem.on('click', function(e){ ... })
// observe clicks inside navigation links in #content
elem.on('click', 'nav a', function(e){ ... })
// all clicks inside links in the document
$(document).on('click', 'a', function(e){ ... })
{% endhighlight %}
