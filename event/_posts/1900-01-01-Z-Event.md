Create and initialize a DOM event of the specified type. If properties object 
is given, use it to extend the new event object. The event is configured to
bubble by default; this can be turned off by setting the `bubbles` property to `false`.

An event initialized with this function can be triggered with
[trigger](#trigger).

{% highlight js %}
$.Event('mylib:change', { bubbles: false })
{% endhighlight %}
