title: $.fn
---

`Zepto.fn` is an object that holds all of the methods that are available on
Zepto collections, such as [`addClass()`](#addClass), [`attr()`](#attr), and
other.  Adding a function to this object makes that method available on every
Zepto collection.

Here's an example implementation of Zepto's [`empty()`](#empty) method:

{% highlight js %}
$.fn.empty = function(){
  return this.each(function(){ this.innerHTML = '' })
}
{% endhighlight %}
