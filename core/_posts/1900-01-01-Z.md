Obtain the Zepto collection object by performing a CSS selector, wrapping DOM
nodes, or creating elements from an HTML string. If context for the selector is
given, perform CSS selector only on descendants of context nodes.

If a function is given, attach it as a handler for the "DOMContentLoaded" event,
making it execute after the DOM on the page is ready. If the page is already
loaded, executes the function immediately.
