  closest(selector, [context]) â‡’ collection
---

Traverse upwards from the current element to find the first element that
matches the selector. If context node is given, consider only elements that are
its descendants. This method is similar to [`parents(selector)`](#parents), but
it only returns the first ancestor matched.

{% highlight js %}
var input = $('input[type=text]')
input.closest('form')
{% endhighlight %}
