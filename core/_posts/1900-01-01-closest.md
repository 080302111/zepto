  closest(element) ⇒ collection [v1.0]

Traverse upwards from the current element to find the first element that
matches the selector. If context node is given, consider only elements that are
its descendants. This method is similar to [`parents(selector)`](#parents), but
it only returns the first ancestor matched.

If a Zepto collection or element is given, the resulting element will have to
match one of the given elements instead of a selector.

{% highlight js %}
var input = $('input[type=text]')
input.closest('form')
{% endhighlight %}
