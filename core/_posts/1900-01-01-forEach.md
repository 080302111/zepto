title: forEach
signature: |
  forEach(function(item, index, array){ ... }, [context])
---

Iterate through every element of the collection. Similar to [each](#each), but
the arguments for the iterator functions are different, and returning `false`
from the iterator won't stop the iteration.

  This is a Zepto-provided method that is not part of the jQuery API.
