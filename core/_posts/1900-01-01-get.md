  get([index])
---

Get all elements or a single element from the current collection. When no index
is given, returns all elements in an ordinary Array. When index is specified,
return only the element at that position. This is different than [eq](#eq) in
the way that the returned node is not wrapped in a Zepto collection.

{% highlight js %}
var elements = $('h2')
elements.get()   //=> get all headings as an Array
elements.get(0)  //=> get first heading node
{% endhighlight %}
