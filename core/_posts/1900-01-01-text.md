Get or set the text content of elements in the collection. When no content is
given, returns the text contents of all the elements in the collection, if no element exists, `null` will be returned. When
content is given, uses it to replace the text contents of each element in the
collection. This is similar to [html](#html), with the exception it can't be
used for getting or setting HTML.
